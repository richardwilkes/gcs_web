## Welcome to the GCS User Guide
**GURPS Character Sheet (GCS)** is an interactive character sheet editor for [GURPS Fourth Edition](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps).

The **GCS User Guide** is your reference for learning and using the app. Whether you’re brand new or experienced, you’ll find guides to help you get the most out of GCS.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This guide focuses on **how to use GCS**, not on teaching the full GURPS rules. For rules, see the relevant [GURPS books](https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/).

## What you’ll find here
This guide includes step-by-step tutorials to [install GCS](Download%20and%20install%20GCS.md), [explore the interface](Explore%20the%20GCS%20interface.md), and [create your first character](Create%20your%20first%20character.md). It also has detailed explanations of the main tools and features in GCS.

See the **Table of Contents** below for a complete list of pages. Most pages cross-link to related topics for easy navigation.

> [!TIP]  
> Throughout the User Guide, you’ll see **page references to GURPS books** (for example, p. B10) to connect GCS features to the rules. See [Page References](Page%20References.md) for details.
