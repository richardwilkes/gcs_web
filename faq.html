            <h2>I'm on Windows and GCS doesn't start! How come?</h2>
            <p>The most likely cause is not having OpenGL 3.2 or better installed on your machine. If you are on an
                older machine without the necessary OpenGL support, you may be able to work around this by putting the
                OpenGL32.dll from <a href="https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag">Mesa</a> into the same directory as
                your GCS.exe file.</p>

            <h2>How can I convert old GCS files to the current format?</h2>
            <p>This depends greatly on just how old the file is. Files made prior to the v4.20 release need to be
                converted using the program found here:
                <a href="https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_json_updater/releases">GCS JSON Updater</a>. This will
                convert them to the v4.20 format.</p>
            <p>Files created before v4.30 need to be converted using the v4.37.1 release. Either open and save each
                file with GCS v4.37.1 or you can use the command line option to convert a bunch of files at once.</p>
            <p>Once GCS v5.x.x can open the file, you can save it from GCS v5.x.x to have it stored in the current
                format.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Can I submit new/revised data files?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely! Almost all of the current data content of GCS was provided by helpful individuals other than
                me. If you have completely new content, please create a new library for it and send the resulting file.
                If, on the other hand, you're modifying one of the existing data files, please be sure to update to the
                latest version from the git repository first, make your changes, then submit a patch file of the
                differences. In either case, please either create a
                <a href="https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_master_library/pulls">Pull Request</a> or an
                <a href="https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_master_library/issues">Issue</a> for the work and attach
                the new file or patch file to that.</p>

            <h2>What page reference abbreviations are being used in the data files?</h2>
            <p>The current list of page reference abbreviations can be found here:

            <h2>Is there a version of GCS localized for my language?</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs_translations">GCS Translations Repo</a> may contain
                one.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Where can I find the global settings file?</h2>
            <p>Its location is dependent upon your specific platform. You can find the location of the settings file by
                running passing <code class="ic">gcs --help</code> on the command line. The output will have the path to
                the settings file, among other things.</p>
            <p>For those of you on macOS, you will need to open a terminal and (assuming you have GCS in the top-level
                Applications folder on your system, type: <code class="ic">/Applications/GCS.app/Contents/MacOS/gcs --help</code></p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>How do I convert my all of my User Library data files to the current file format?</h2>
            <p>If you don't want to manually load and then save each data file to convert it to the current file format,
                you can use the command line to update every data file at once. How this works depends on your
                computer's operating system.</p>
            <p>Warning: Misusing the command line can seriously damage your operating system. Unless you know what
                you're doing, proceed carefully and don't deviate from the instructions below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Backup your User Library.</li>
                <li>Open a terminal (macOS and Linux) or the command prompt (Windows). On Windows, you can do this by
                    typing "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar and clicking on the first result.</li>
                <li>Issue the convert command by typing:
                    <code class="ic">"PATH_TO_GCS" --convert "PATH_TO_USER_LIBRARY"</code>
                    substituting the full paths to GCS and the User Library as appropriate. Note that you should make
                    sure the paths have quotes around them as shown above, in case they contain spaces.
                    <br>On Windows, the path to GCS might look like this:
                    <code class="ic">C:\Program Files\GCS\gcs.exe</code>
                    <br>On macOS, the path to GCS might look like this:
                    <code class="ic">/Applications/GCS.app/Contents/MacOS/gcs</code>
                    <br>On Linux, the path to GCS might look like this:
                    <code class="ic">/usr/local/bin/gcs</code>
                    <br>The path to the User Library can be found by opening GCS, right-clicking on the User Library folder,
                    selecting Configure, then copying everything in the Path field in the settings tab that comes up.
                </li>
                <li>When the command is run, it will start listing the files it is converting. Once it finishes, you can
                    close the terminal. If the command gives you an error instead of listing your files, go back to step
                    3 and try again, double checking that your file paths are correct and that you're typing everything
                    correctly, spaces included. Note that files that are too old to be opened by the current version may
                    need you to install an older version of GCS to do a conversion to bring them up to a version that
                    the current version can process.</li>
                <li>Open GCS and verify that you can open your data files.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Can I define my own standard hit location tables and have them show up in the combo for selection?</h2>
            <p>Yes. Make sure to give the table a unique ID, then export it and place it in a directory named
                "Hit Locations" at the top level of one of your GCS Library directories.</p>
